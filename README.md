# Team Chiru Guidelines
This guide attempts to be used as a centralized configuration for all team chiru project. It needs to be used as an easy set-up in order to quickly have an operational workspace for each team-chiru's project. This file is simply a list of useful recommendations and cannot be used has a strict guide, but be warmed that all these configurations are supposed to be strongly adopted by all team-chiru's projects.

**Be careful**: this guide must be edited first in the collaborative [Team Chiru Guidelines Draft](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Team-Chiru-Guidelines-Draft-YHh8yPhFpgz4b5cRPXlgA) which needs to be used as a suggestions board.

## Configuration Guide
The recommended text editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Editor
All basic configurations are described into an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file.

### Extensions



## Style Guide
### Javascript & Typescript
The style guide is completely provided by the [standardJS style](https://standardjs.com/). It is strongly recommended to have both the StandardJS linter editor plugin and the node command line linter installed. This style convention included the *typescript* style.

The team-chiru's used package manager for js project is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and all configuration **doesn't require any `--global` configurations**.

## TODO lists
